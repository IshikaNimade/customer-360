Big Data To Avoid Weather Related Flight Delays


INTRODUCTION:->
==============

This paper identifies key aviation data sets for operational analytics,
presents a methodology for application of big-data analysis methods to operational problems, 
and offers examples of analytical solutions using an integrated aviation data warehouse.
Big-data analysis methods have revolutionized how both government and commercial researchers 
can analyze massive aviation databases that were previously too cumbersome, inconsistent
or irregular to drive high-quality output. Traditional data-mining methods
are effective on uniform data sets such as flight tracking data or weather.
Integrating heterogeneous data sets introduces complexity in data standardization, normalization,
and scalability. The variability of underlying data warehouse can be leveraged using virtualized cloud 
infrastructure for scalability to identify trends and create actionable information. The applications
for big-data analysis in airspace system performance and safety optimization have high potential because 
of the availability and diversity of airspace related data. Analytical applications to quantitatively review airspace
performance, operational efficiency and aviation safety require a broad data set.Individual information
sets such as radar tracking data or weather reports provide slices of relevant data, but do not provide the required context,
perspective and detail on their own to create actionable knowledge. These data sets are published by diverse sources 
and do not have the standardization,uniformity or defect controls required for simple integration and analysis.
At a minimum, aviation big-data research requires the fusion of airline, aircraft, flight, radar, crew, and weather 
data in a uniform taxonomy, organized so that queries can be automated by flight, by fleet, or across the airspace
system.



Currently, travelling through air is considered as one of the
majorly utilized transportation media. This booming trend is
due to advancements in the tourism industry. Due to these
growth patterns, there have been rising needs for developing
the capacity of the airports. The demands are constantly
increasing on the higher verge and it indirectly leads to
congestion at the airports and delays in flights. These delay
problems eventually result in forming an imbalance in consumers demands and capacity of the airport.
Flight delay is acknowledged as one of the striking indicators of performance in the aviation business. It generates
problems for both air commuters and the aviation industry
in the form of time and money. It also lowers the esteem
and creates a huge loss on the business of airlines as well as
airport authorities. Delay in flights also endanger the marketing
and business strategies as aviation industries are majorly
dependent on the trustworthiness of its customer. Certain delay
performance not only influences customers choice towards preferring airlines but also causes drastic harm to the ecosystem.
Utilization of fuels and eruption of harmful pollutants are also
some of the environment harming agents which are caused
due to delays. Therefore, it becomes essential to plan and
minimize the delay causing by making use of newly accessible
technologies.
In recent year, numerous technological advancements have
been witnessed one of which is big data technologies. The
features of big data technologies assist in determining various
factors which are unexplored in the datasets. Big data can
readily handle a massive volume of data at high complexity
and speed. Moreover, it helps in rendering data which demands
much more enhanced methods for saving, processing and
investigating the hidden knowledge present in the data. [1]
This knowledge then can be reflected by making use of
different graphs and facts which would help in understanding
the insights of data in a more clear way.
The project makes use of flight dataset of U.S airlines
which is brought into attention. Data for flights are generated
regularly in very extensive volume as there are many regular
operating flights. This dataset holds different parameters related to flight details and delay information. Parameters such
as date of flight, name of airlines, source as well as destination
airports, the city as well as state names, the volume of flight
handled, factors causing delays and many more. These insights
would assist in discovering distinctive patterns from historical
data.
Employing these big data technologies it would become exceptional in discovering root causes of flight delays. Moreover,
these historical fight data would serve in finding unusual delay
trends in airlines which would show daily, weekly and monthly
delay patterns. The conclusions obtained would also be helping
to build important trends about most airlines and airports
used as well as popular destinations among air passengers.
These trends and drifts would benefit the aviation industry to
provide useful analytics on passengers and the performance
of airlines as well as airports. It would additionally help
airport authorities to avoid large penalties and might increase
customer satisfaction and trustworthiness.
This report is further distributed into different sections
where section 2 holds a literature review, whereas section 3
introduces the methodology used in this project. Section 4
addresses the use cases and result presented out of the data
and finally, section 5 shows conclusions, limitations and future
work.
























Application :->
==============

• We can use big data to collect large set of informations and use it for data ware
house purpose.
• Using this technique we can predict the weather information of next 2,3 month
in advance . Using this we can avoid the delays as well as cancellation of
flight due to bad weather.
• Big data can also use for data mining purpose.
• By using big data we can analyse the large set of information.



Predictive maintenance:->
=========================

Today’s next-generation of aircraft engines are equipped with multiple 
sensors that generate massive amounts of data. As an example, an Airbus A350 aircraft has 6,000 
sensors producing 2.5Tb of data per day. These sensors measure health and performance and provide 
insights by tracking everything from fuel flow, pressure and temperature to the aircraft’s altitude, 
speed, weather and air temperature. By combining this real-time information with historical data and 
robust analytics, airlines can determine the condition of in-service equipment to make proactive decisions
on maintenance schedules and ways to maximise aircraft availability. This result in greater efficiency in the
maintenance, repair and overhaul process and enhanced fleet management. 
Predictive maintenance not only enables airlines to keep earning revenue by preventing groundings and 
disruptions but also helps improve safety by preventing equipment failure.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:->
===================

BUSINESS CASE 1 - 
Which airports are among the
most used airports in United States ?
Technology Used - Apache Hive.
This business query shows density plot of airports which are
mostly considered by air passenger’s to travel. For performing
this task the data was first loaded into MySQL database.
Moreover, the data is then stored into Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS) and lastly by using Sqoop command the
data tables are loaded into Apache Hive. This business query
was finally performed by making use of Apache Hive and
the output was stored in HBase by creating an external table.
For obtaining this query result, source airports were grouped
together to find total number of count of each airports

The above graphs depicts some of the most utilized airports
of United States considered for travelling. From the above
map, it can be easily depicted that more air passengers opt
to travel usually from Atlanta Airport followed by O’Hare
International Airport whereas Seattle and Salt Lake City
International where least chosen for travelling. This query
would help the airport authorities in handling large number
of flight and increase airport capacity for travelling passenger

BUSINESS CASE 2 - 
Which destinations are popular
among the air passengers for travelling?
Technology Used - Apache Pig.
This query was performed by making use of Apache
Pig where the input data is obtained from HDFS and is
further imported into Pig through the help of Apache Sqoop.
The above bar graph labelled as Popular Destination show
trending visuals out the data. For obtaining the resultant bar
graph pig query was used, were columns holding destination
city name were first grouped together and count of the
grouped data was obtained. Further, limit clause was applied
to obtain 10 popular destinations city where passengers
traveller from U.S. Airports. The graph provides a clear idea
on displaying most popular destinations to where Atlanta
leads the table followed by Chicago. Denver was considered
as least opted destination for travelling purposes. This query
may be helpful not only for the aviation industry in terms of
increasing number of flight but also would be beneficial for
tourism and hospitality industry.

BUSINESS CASE 3 - 
Which top ten airlines does
passengers prefer for travelling?
Technology Used - Hadoop Mapreduce.
For the evaluation of 3rd query MapReduce Java Program
was taken into consideration where the dataset from HDFS
is utilized. The main goal is to obtain the top ten airlines
favored for travelling.
Mapper - Over here, airlines name was taken as input to the
mapper which is obtained from MySQL table. A condition was
applied for the mapper that was [month of year.equals(”1”)]
Reducer - The code for reducer contains count of the column
as well as filtration which was (top.size() ¿ 10) where only
results of top ten airlines were fetched.
The output obtained depicts the top ten airlines of United
States which are in mostly preferred by the passengers for
travelling purposes. In this graph, Southwest Airlines (WN)
clearly wins the title for most busiest airlines whereas Alaska
airlines is at the bottom in the list of top ten airlines of United
States. This information would be useful for airlines industry
increasing the number of flights for fulfilling customer
demands. Also, other airlines company can understand their
competitors strategy.

BUSINESS CASE 4 - 
Airports facing maximum arrival and departure delay ?
Technology Used - Apache Hive
This case was used to determine the changing patterns
in the delay faced by airports including both arrival as well
as departure delays. The output for this query is obtained by
using queries supporting in Apache Hive. This query was
obtained using average value of arrival and departure delays
and are grouped with their airport names. Delays having
positive and above zero level values are considered

The results present in the visualization clearly describes
the delay patterns of different airports. The airports facing
maximum arrival delay is Minneapolis Airport and departure
delay are mostly faced by Chattanooga Airport. Whereas,
it can be easily concluded that Washington airport suffers
majorly by both arrival as well as departure delays. This study
would help the airport authorities in order to minimize these
delays as delays creates negative impact both on business and
customers. Also, many other losses like operational cost, fuel
cost and compensation cost can be minimized if delays are
avoided.

BUSINESS CASE 5 - 
Which factors causes major delays
for January month?
Technology Used - Hadoop Mapreduce
The evaluation of 5th query was done using MapReduce Java
Program and in the similar manner dataset from HDFS was
utilized. 4 different types of delays which affect the
Mapper - Over here, 4 different types of delay which effects
aircraft’s performance were obtained. A word-count program
was written for the column of MySQL database labelled as
cancellation-code for the input.
Reducer - The columns contained 4 different alphabets
resembling different types of delay caused in air-crafts. The
reducer code displays the word count values for each distinct
alphabet present in the particular column.

The donut graph was created using Power BI tool which
depicts different types of delay faced by aviation industry.
It can be easily understood that most delays are caused due
to bad weather which contributes about 67.5 percent of the
delays. Carrier delay and National Aviation System delay
contributes nearly same amount of delay. The least affecting
cause of delay is security delay this can be further reduced
by engaging more staffs. This results would be very much
important for aviation industry to minimize or eliminate
delays and reduce operating cost.

BUSINESS CASE 6 - 
Which day of the January Month have
seen the most and least number of cancellation due to bad
weather ?
Technology Used - Apache Hive.
This use case discusses about which day faces most
weather based delays. This use case shows line graph of
airports which are mostly considered by air passenger’s to
travel. For performing this task the data was first loaded into
MySQL database. The data is then stored into (HDFS) and
finally Sqoop command was used to load data into Apache
Hive. The query result was obtained using WHERE clause
on ”cancellation code” column and the results were group
accordingly with the ”day of month” column

This business case was motivated from above results where
aircraft’s are mainly affected due to bad weather was most
prominent. This query shows which days of the month has
been greatly affected due to bad weathers. The above graphs
helps in understanding days which are badly impacted due
to weather where 30th day of January shows most delay.
Furthermore, 25th day January has minimum effect of bad
weather.

BUSINESS CASE 7 - 
What amount of flights are diverted
in the month of January ?
Technology Used - Apache Pig.
This business query was implemented using Apache
Pig and input data was utilized from HDFS. The query
talks about number of diversions took place in the month
of January. For this first filter was applied on ”diverted”
columns conceiving value 1 and count was obtained for the
same. Then the data was grouped together with source and
destination airport names. Finally the result was ordered
accordingly.
This query was is next level of consideration for previous
query i.e. query 6. As query 6 showed number of cancellations
due to bad weather, this query helps to understand the results
of number of diversions that took place. From the above
graph route of ”Friedman Memorial Airport - SUN” and
”Salt Lake International Airport - SLC” showed larger number
of diversion. On similar trends, routes from ”Aspen/Pitkin
County Airport - ASE” to ”George Bush Intercontinental
Airport - IAH” had least number of diversions in flights.


CONCLUSION:->
============

Flight delays is considered as one of the prime drawback
for aviation industry. Delays has also increased these days
becoming one of the serious problems. To minimize the effects
of delay on aviation industry, a crucial understanding of the
patterns is much needed. These hidden patterns are identified
in this project by using big data analytic. Large volume
of dataset obtained from U.S. aviation industry are been
analyzed using big data technologies. This project involves
the use of different big-data technologies such as MySQL,
Hadoop Mapreduce, Sqoop,Hive, Pig and Hbase. Utilizing
these technologies would support in developing insights and
generating useful information and patterns out of the data.
These technologies have proved to be fruitful in determining the solutions to the problems face by the airports and
airlines. Results shows that effect of bad weather has major
impact on flight delays. The historical data of U.S. aviation
industry which are differentiated into days and weeks also
helps in understanding valuable information related to delays.
These insights would be very helpful to aviation industry for
minimizing delays and take necessary decisions to eliminated
delays. Machine learning techniques can be implemented on
these dataset for forecasting delays.
